                When accessing the website – your own personal blog – the first thing you see is the welcome page.
                There you are greeted with a message and a button that would bring you to an overview of all your blog
                entries. But there is also an index to the left from where you could go to particular blog entries
                directly. Above all that is a bar containing your blog’s name and buttons for editing and adding blog
                entries as well as the button that brought you here – to the documentation of the website.
                While there was still no particular article selected the edit button will not respond whereas the add
                entry button can be called from any point in the website.
                On the right you can see the chat which will be explained in detail later.

            <p>
                After pressing the “show entries” button you get to the homepage – a place where all your public
                entries are listed chronologically. You get to read their title and short description. If you want to
                read further into a certain entry there is a button for each one that brings you to the whole text.

                Once you chose an entry to read more about you will reach this screen. In addition to the information
                you get from the homepage you can also see the full text of the article as well as any pictures that
                may be uploaded. Underneath the title you have two buttons – one for getting back to the homepage and
                one for deleting the current entry. Now the edit button will also be activated so you can edit the
                entry you’re just reading. You may also have noticed that the index popped open to facilitate reading
                through the blog without the need to get back to the homepage every time.

                This is the index. You can reach it from every page of your blog by just clicking on it. It separates
                the articles into public (left) and private (right) entries which can be reached through the according
                button on top of the entry list. If you chose an article from this list you will reach the same page
                you’re just seeing for the article selected.

                Here you can see the main view when editing an entry. Everything that was there before will be
                automatically added to the corresponding field so you don’t have to rewrite the whole article.
                Underneath you can find the option to upload images. You can either select them by browsing through
                your files or you can just drag & drop them. After uploading you can see them added to the file list
                where you also have the option to delete the uploaded files. You also have the option to draw images
                on your own. On the bottom you can see buttons to save your changes or to cancel the editing process.
                This view will also be presented when you choose to add a new entry. Everything is the same except
                that all fields will be empty.

                Here you can see what it looks like when you write something in the chat. Before you can do that
                though you are asked to choose a username which will stay the same while you’re on the blog. After
                that you can write messages and everybody that is currently on your blog will receive them. And even
                users who join later will receive the last 20 messages that were in the chat. Other users can also
                participate in the chat the same way that you can.
