To start hosting our Web App you will need MongoDB, Node.js and a terminal to call it from.
We used WebStorm's built in bash terminal to do this.
First you need to run/host your database on your machine locally, then run "npm install"
to get all the necessary packages and lastly type "npm start" into the terminal to host
the Web App to localhost on port 5000.
